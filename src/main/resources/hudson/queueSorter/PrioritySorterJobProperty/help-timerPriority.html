	The priority adjustment for user-ran builds.  Priorities are used when all executors are busy to
	decide which job in the build queue to run next.  A job with higher priority is ran before jobs with
	lower priorities.<br /><br />

	This priority adjustment is applied to builds scheduled by users.  It is added to the job's priority
	number.
